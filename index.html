    <p>About Me: I am from Arzona originally but moved to New Mexico during middle school. I am studying architecture here at the University of New Mexico and I am a second year. I enjoy New Mexico because there is lots of outdoor activities such as hiking. This call has taught me a lot and I am glad I chose to take this class. The class has been somewhat hard as I have no idea what I am doing, but I know that these skills are very beneficial. </p>

    <p>Portfolio: I have worked as a social medi intern for 2 years for New Mexico Dental Institue. I have also worked in retail at Kendra Scott from 2022-2023.</p>
